# Reddit-Wrapper-FS

A Reddit API-wrapper written in F# using the .NET library. It's a side-project, so anything written in this project is not intended for commercial use or production.

The point of this project is to improve my skills in programming with F# and the functional programming paradigm, but also learning to use .NET.
